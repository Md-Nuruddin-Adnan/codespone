              <p>
                  In order to provide you with the best possible platform for online course creation we collect and process quite a bit of information. The purpose of this privacy policy is to help you better understand how we store, collect, and process your personal data. This policy is meant to help you understand more about why we collect and use your data whether you’re a Vonza customer or a student/subscriber to a Vonza site who uses the Vonza application or services (together known as, “The Services”), a participant in Vonza’s partner or affiliate program, or even if you’re just visiting the Vonza website. By using any of Vonza’s services or by interacting with a Vonza customer using The Services, you are agreeing to the terms of the Privacy Policy and, as applicable, the Vonza Terms of Service. In particular, by visiting this website you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this privacy policy, including any updates or revisions to this privacy policy. This policy does not apply to information collected by any third party, including through any application or content that may be accessible from this website.
                  <br> <br>
                  This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally to reflect changes to operational or legal practices, or for regulatory reasons. If and when we make changes to this policy, we will notify you of the changes by posting the revised policy on this Website or by other means when appropriate. By continuing to use this Website or the Support Service after these changes are posted, you agree to the revised terms.
                  <br> <br>
                  
                  We’ve broken this policy down into different sections so you can better understand what areas are applicable to you.

            <h2>Information we collect from our customers</h2>
            <p>
              In order to offer The Services, we need to collect information from our customers. Here is a summary of the information that we collect from our customers and what we do with it:
              <br><br>
              We collect your name, email address, and IP address. We need this information to provide you with our Services, for example, to confirm your identity and contact you.
              <br><br>
              You may voluntarily provide additional information related to the registered account such as any API key provided or images or videos you choose to upload.
              <br><br>
              We collect data about the Vonza-hosted webpages that you visit. We also collect data about how and when you access your account in order to give you access and at the same time improve our Services.
              <br><br>
              When you voluntarily share personal information with us in the course of offering your course and using our services, we store that Personal Information.
              <br><br>
              When transactions between you and our website involve payment by credit card, debit card, checks, money orders, and/or third party online payment services, we will collect information related to the transaction as part of the course of doing business with you, including billing address, telephone number, and other information related to the transaction.
              <br><br>
              When you share personal information about your customers (“learners”) we store that information for you so that you can process enrollments and better serve your customers.
              <br><br>
              This information is collected when you sign up for our Services, when you access our Services or otherwise provide us with the information. In some circumstances, when you have given us express permission, we will also use and store your personal information.

          <p>
            In order to provide you with our product and services, we store information about your students so that you can administer your course(s).
            <br><br>
            Here is some more details on what information we collect and why:
            <br><br>
            We allow you to collect the name, email, and any other personal information from your customers. Name and email are needed to allow individuals to access our Services for processes such as processing enrolments, authentication, or otherwise administering your course. This information is given on a voluntary basis when a customer uses or accesses our Services, for example when a customer visits a Vonza site, enrolls in a course, or signs up for an account on a Vonza site.
            <br><br>
            As a student progresses through your course(s) we collect information about how they interact with the course, including but not limited to, their progress through the course, quiz scores, survey results, discussion or forum contributions and other student activities.
            <br><br>
            You may collect additional information about your learners in the course of administering your course. As a course administrator, it is your responsibility to ensure that information is being collected lawfully. You should consider using a Privacy Policy or even consulting with legal counsel to understand how to ensure you are appropriately protecting the privacy of your learners.
            <br><br>
            While we technically process this information via the Vonza platform in order to administer The Services, you have the ability to access and remove this information at any point. We do not access this information unless requested by a Vonza customer.

          <p> We will save your PII until you erase or delete your account or otherwise exercise your right to erase your PII. </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Access to Your Information and other rights</h2>
          <p>
              You are, at any time and free of charge, entitled to receive a copy of the PII that we hold about you and information about the processing thereof. Please note that Vonza needs to be able to determine your identity in order to be able to respond to your request.
              <br><br>
              If you believe that any PII we are holding is incorrect or incomplete please send an email with your specific request to privacy@Vonza.com. We will work with you to make any corrections deemed necessary. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. Additionally, note that registered Instructors and Students may change visibility of their respective personal information throughout our website by editing their personal profiles.
              <br><br>
              You have the right to request that Vonza restricts the processing of your PII under certain conditions. For example, if you contest the accuracy of the PII, the processing may be restricted for a period enabling Vonza to verify the accuracy of the PII or if Vonza no longer needs the PII for the purposes of the processing but you require the PII for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
              <br><br>
              You have the right to have your PII deleted without undue delay and Vonza is obliged to delete your PII without undue delay if, for example, the PII is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected or otherwise processed. Please note that Vonza is not obliged to delete the PII if Vonza can show that the processing is necessary, for example, for the establishment, exercise, or defense of a legal claim.
              <br><br>
              If you provide your email address to Vonza, you will always have the opportunity to opt out of receiving email newsletters and promotions through the unsubscribe link in the email communications or by logging into and changing the preferences for your user account. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a credit card processing partner) before you changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change your preferences directly with that third party.
              <br><br>
              You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to Vonza’s processing of your PII if the processing is based on, for example, legitimate interests. If you object to such processing, Vonza will no longer be entitled to process your PII based on such legal basis, unless Vonza can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights, and freedom or if it is conducted for the establishment, exercise, or defense of a legal claim.
              <br><br>
              You have, under certain conditions, the right to receive the PII concerning you and which you have provided to Vonza, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit such PII to another data controller without Vonza trying to prevent this, where Vonza’s processing of your PII is based on a contract or consent and the processing is carried out by automated means. In such case you have the right to request that the PII shall be transmitted from Vonza directly to another data controller, where technically feasible.
              <br><br>
              You also have the right to withdraw your consent, if applicable. If you withdraw your consent, please note that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on your consent before its withdrawal and that Vonza may, under certain circumstances, have another legal ground for the processing and therefore may be entitled to continue the processing.
              <br><br>
              If you would like to exercise your rights, you may contact us on the contact details provided at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.
              <br><br>
              If you are unhappy with our processing of your PII or of an alleged infringement of the General Data Protection Regulation or other applicable data privacy laws, you may lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority, for example in the country of your habitual residence or place of work.

          <h2>Our Policy Concerning Children</h2>
          <p>
              As stated in our Terms of Use, our website and Services are offered and available only to you if are 18 years or older, or if you are between 13 and 18 years old and have obtained the consent of a parent or legal guardian prior to accessing the website, registering an account, or using the Services. If you do not meet this eligibility requirement, you may not use our website or Services. Vonza does not knowingly collect or store any personal information from or about children under the age of 13. We will delete such information if we become aware that it has been submitted through our website. Parents or legal guardians who believe that Vonza might have any information from or about a child under the age of 13 may submit a request to 
             <a href="#" class="link">accounts@Vonza.com </a> and request that such information be removed.
          </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Securing Your Information</h2>
          <p>
              Vonza takes a range of security measures designed to protect your PII and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature) and free from any unauthorized alteration. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of financial information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
              <br><br>
              Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. As the safety and security of your information also depends on the precautions you take, we ask you not to share your password with anyone.
          </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Third Parties and Other Information Collectors</h2>
          <p>
              Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties through our website, whether between Instructor and Student or other Users or individuals, different rules may apply to their use, collection, and disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. Since we do not control the information use, collection, or disclosure policies of third parties, you are subject to their privacy policies.
              <br><br>
              Our website may include links to third party websites. Once you have used these links to leave our website, you should note that we do not have any control over third party websites. We are not responsible for the content of such websites or the protection and privacy of any information which you provide while visiting such sites. Third-party websites are not governed by this Privacy Policy. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy policies applicable to the websites in question.
          </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Do-Not-Track Procedures</h2>
          <p>
              Note that any Do-Not-Track instructions from your browser or similar mechanism will not affect our collection of the data that you voluntarily provide to Vonza through such means as browsing our website, signing up for any of the Services or any Courses, entering PII into information fields on our website, or posting on any of our forums or blogs. Be advised that third parties are free to collect any information that you volunteer to Vonza that is visible to the public. Therefore, please do not provide Vonza with any information that you do not want collected.
